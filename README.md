## Welcome to my Cat App (CApp for short)

This app accesses the Cat API AKA Cats as a service
thecatapi.com

The purpose of this app is simply to render two images or gifs of cats on refresh within the kitty page, it makes a call for 10 images (the API only takes requests of a single image or an array of 10) and then exctracts the URL of the first two indices in the array, then displays them as an image component.
